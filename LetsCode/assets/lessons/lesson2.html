<p>In Java, every line of code that can actually run needs to be inside a class. This line declares a class named Main, which is public, that means that any other class can access it. This is not important for now, so don't worry. For now, we'll just write our code in a class called Main, and talk about objects later on.</p>
<p>Notice that when we declare a public class, we must declare it inside a file with the same name (Main.java), otherwise we'll get an error when compiling.</p>
<p>When running the examples on the site, we will not use the public keyword, since we write all our code in one file.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>The next line is:</strong></p><br/>

<p>This is the entry point of our Java program. the main method has to have this exact signature in order to be able to run our program.</p>

<p>This is the entry point of our Java program. the main method has to have this exact signature in order to be able to run our program.</p>



	<p>System is a pre-defined class that Java provides us and it holds some useful methods and variables.</p>
	<p>out is a static variable within System that represents the output of your program (stdout).</p>
	<p>println is a method of out that can be used to print a line.</p>
